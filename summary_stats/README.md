## Summary stats in this study

### 1-1, cdr3qtl_MVML_amino_acid_geno_all_results.txt.gz
cdr3-QTL analysis results using amino acid genotype and multivariate multple regression model.

### 1-2, cdr3qtl_MVML_amino_acid_geno_all_results.rm_gl.txt.gz
same as 1-1, but used CDR3 phenotypes excluding germline-encoded sequences (main results in the manuscript).

### 2-1, cdr3qtl_MVML_classical_geno_all_results.txt.gz
cdr3-QTL analysis results using classical allele genotype and multivariate multple regression model.

### 2-2, cdr3qtl_MVML_classical_geno_all_results.rm_gl.txt.gz
same as 2-1, but used CDR3 phenotypes excluding germline-encoded sequences (main results in the manuscript).

### 3-1, cdr3qtl_LM_amino_acid_geno_all_results.txt.gz
cdr3-QTL analysis results using amino acid genotype and linear regression model.

### 3-2, cdr3qtl_LM_amino_acid_geno_all_results.rm_gl.txt.gz
same as 3-1, but used CDR3 phenotypes excluding germline-encoded sequences (main results in the manuscript).

### 4-1, cdr3qtl_LM_hla_risk_score_aa_all_results.txt.gz
cdr3-QTL analysis results using HLA risk scores and linear regression model.

### 4-2, cdr3qtl_LM_hla_risk_score_aa_all_results.rm_gl.txt.gz
same as 4-1, but used CDR3 phenotypes excluding germline-encoded sequences (main results in the manuscript).

### 5-1, cdr3qtl_LM_hla_risk_score_aa_feature_all_results.txt.gz
cdr3-QTL analysis results using HLA risk scores and linear regression model. The phenotype is amino acid features, not amino acid frequencies.

### 5-2, cdr3qtl_LM_hla_risk_score_aa_feature_all_results.rm_gl.txt.gz
save as 5-1, but used CDR3 phenotypes excluding germline-encoded sequences (main results in the manuscript).
